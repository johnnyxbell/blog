*StackShare - Decisions*

Soooo we at StackShare have launched something amazing, You can now leave decisions about what tech you chose and why... To find out what its all about it head over and [read more about it](https://stackshare.io/posts/introducing-stack-decisions) or if you don't have an account [Signup for StackShare (what are you waiting for)](https://stackshare.io/)
