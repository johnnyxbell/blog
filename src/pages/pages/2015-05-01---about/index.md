Currently working at Stackshare in San Francisco, California.

I've been coding the internet for the past 10 years and working all over the world. Over that time, Iâ€™ve managed people, been a tech lead; now, I love being an individual contributor and calling the Bay Area home! 

In the past I've worked for Doctor.com and FoyerLive in San Francisco CA, as well as Officeworks, DT Digital, IE Digital in Melbourne AU.

Outside of technology, I like skateboarding, going to concerts, hiking, relaxing with my other half, discovering new areas around the US, tasting new craft beers, and annoying my girlfriend by getting more tattoos.
